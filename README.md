# Cloud Service Placement Diploma Thesis
Above is implemented a placement solution strategy for various algorithms to produce a more cost-efficient Kubernetes Pods placement in the current application used.

## Algorithms Presented
1) Heuristic First Fit Algorithm
2) Binary Partition - Bin Packing
3) K-Partition - Bin Packing
4) Bisecting K-Means - Bin Packing

## Application Used
The application used was a development by Google Cloud Platform for benchmarking presenting an [OnlineBoutique Shop](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo).

INFO: The Kubernetes Cluster can run and be processed from any engine host including local process with minikube.
